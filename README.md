# Harp: Liquity Frontend

Harp is a decentralized financial instrument. It incentivizes staking of the native tokens for the [Liquity Protocol](https://github.com/liquity/dev#readme). Specifically the LUSD token inside the Stability Pool. It creates this incentive by rewarding stakers of the Gov Token with sites kickbacks.

We are very strong supporters of the Liquity Protocol and believe deeply that decentralized financial products are critical to insure the future is more fair, free, and open! For these reasons we have developed Harp, and plan to maintain it, to be open source and to offer added incentives for Liquity Protocol interactions
